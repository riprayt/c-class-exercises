Spring had come early that year, with warm quick rains and sudden frothing of pink peach blossoms and dogwood dappling with white stars the dark river swamp and far off hills. Already the plowing was nearly finished and the bloody glory of the sunset colored the fresh cut furrows of red Georgia clay to even redder hues. The moist hungry earth waiting upturned for the cotton seeds showed pinkish on the sandy tops of furrows vermilion and scarlet and maroon where shadows lay along the sides of the trenches. The whitewashed brick plantation house seemed an island set in a wild red sea a sea of spiraling curving crescent billows petrified suddenly at the moment when the pink tipped waves were breaking into surf. For here were no long straight furrows such as could be seen in the yellow clay fields of the flat middle Georgia country or in the lush black earth of the coastal plantations. The rolling foothill country of north Georgia was plowed in a million curves to keep the rich earth from washing down into the river bottoms.
